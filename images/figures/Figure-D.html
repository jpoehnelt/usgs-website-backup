<p><u>Center image of global cropland (irrigated and  rainfed) areas @ 1 km for year 2000</u> produced by overlying the remote sensing derived product of the International  Water Management Institute (IWMI; Thenkabail et al., 2012, 2011, 2009a, 2009b; <a href="http://www.iwmigiam.org">http://www.iwmigiam.org</a>) over 5 dominant crops (wheat, rice, maize, barley  and soybeans) of the world produced by Ramankutty et al. (2008). The 5 crops  constitute about 60% of all global cropland areas. The IWMI remote sensing  product is derived using remotely sensed data fusion (e.g., NOAA AVHRR, SPOT  VGT, JERS SAR), secondary data (e.g., elevation, temperature, and  precipitation), and <em>in-situ</em> data.  Total area of croplands is 1.53 billion hectares of which 399 million hectares  is total area available for irrigation (without considering cropping intensity)  and 467 million hectares is annualized irrigated areas (considering cropping  intensity). <u>Surrounding NDVI images of irrigated areas</u>: The January to  December irrigated area NDVI dynamics is produced using NOAA AVHRR NDVI. The  irrigated areas were determined by Thenkabail et al. (2011, 2009a, b).</p>
