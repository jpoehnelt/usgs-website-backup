The spatial distribution of global cropland areas (~1.5 billion hectares) and five dominant crop types (wheat, rice, maize, barley and soybeans). This composite map was produced by Thenkabail and Gumma through spatial modeling involving remote sensing derived global irrigated and rainfed croplands (Thenkabail et al., 2011, 2009a, 2009b) and five dominant global crop types from other sources (Ramankutty et al. (2008), Monfreda et al. (2008), and Portman et al. (2009)). The 5 crops constitute about 60% of all global cropland areas. <br />
